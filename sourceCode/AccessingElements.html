            Now we are going to see the how the script tag works in a html.
            we can use <script> tag to write our javascript separately to achieve clean coding.
                Also, whenever the page loads the javascript loads in the first palce.
                you can run the code and check execution flow on your own.
         -->
        <script type="text/javascript">

            // for checking both the lines below you have to execute it one by one and comment out the lines accordingly.
            alert(" Welcome your Page have been relaoded! ");   

            document.getElementById("text").innerHTML = "Hello ChangedText";

            /* 
                Here I am trying to demostrate how we can access the html element into our javascript
                and change it to the new one which we want to set.

                so here we are accessing the text based on the id and setting it to the new one through javascript.

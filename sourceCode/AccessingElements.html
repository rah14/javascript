            Now we are going to see the how the script tag works in a html.
            we can use <script> tag to write our javascript separately to achieve clean coding.
                Also, whenever the page loads the javascript loads in the first palce.
                you can run the code and check execution flow on your own.

            alert(" Welcome your Page have been relaoded! ");

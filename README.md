#                           javascript
    This repository contains all the code example's of JavaScript topic's.

    Whoever is taking this course should put some of the points in their mind.
    Also, some facts about the chrome development tool.

#                   Let me Explain some of it.

    Generally, the Chrome dev tool is used for debugging the code And many more.
    you will get to explore it throughout the course.
    
    Let me list out the components which are useful while javascript project
    development. Elements, Console, Sources, Application, and many more are
    there, but I have listed the frequently used Chrome dev tools.
    
    I am going to explain the console for now as you all are beginners. As, you
    will go further with this tutorial you will get to know more about the other 
    dev tools.
    
    Let us see what element's role is in our development and how it is useful.
    
    Element's - We use this Chrome dev tool to check the source code of the 
    particular portion of the code visible in the User Interface by selecting 
    that part you can click on the inspect and it will show you the classes and
    the tags that have been used which function have been called by the inspected
    portion of the page. Also, this tool is mainly used by the designers
    
    Console - It gives you two powerful features one is that you can write the 
    Javascript directly and the second one is whenever you make any mistake 
    because of that if you get the error Javascript is not very good for 
    providing compile time errors so it will be very hard for us to find out that 
    which portion of the code is giving errors so there come's the role of the 
    console. In console you can be able to see in the error message with the line
    address which line of code is throwing the error.
